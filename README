Test Scripts
-------------

fit_run -- set up params, call fit_tran, plot results

fit_plots -- more plots, followup to fit_run

fit_parts -- run fit_tran on a set of obs partitions 

spec_test1 -- quick look at gas cell count spectra harvested with
    the old-format reader MITreader5b, but using new ccast routines
    inst_params and igm2spec.

spec_test2 -- compare observed and calculated gas cell transmittance
    with old-format obs, but using ccast routines and kc2cris from
    the airs_decon package

spec_test3 -- look at spectral signal to noise ratio


Functions
----------

cmp_tran -- compare observed and calculated transmittances.  
    a total rewrite of the old FM2008/cmp_tran6, mainly derived
    from the demo script spec_test2.  There is no params file or
    defaults--all params are passed in or by inst_params. 

fit_tran -- find wlaser deltas to match obs and calc.  
    derived from the old script version of fit_tran.  The search
    was moved to this function, and the rest to a wrapper script
    to fit_run

fp_default -- build default SRF matrix for new gas cell tests

fp_exelis -- build an SRF matrix from recent Exelis test data

read_igm -- simple wrapper to load IGM data from the MIT reader

fit_info -- print fit_tran residuals and weights

fovcolors -- 9 distinct colors for FOV plots

fovnames --  FOV names for plot legend


Laser Tests
------------

Tests and code from FM2013 needs to be merged into this repo
